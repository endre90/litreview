Digital Twin (DT) has become the key technology and tool for manufacturing industries to realize intelligent cyber-physical integration and digital transformation by leveraging these technologies. Although there have been many DT-related works, there is no standard definition, unified framework, and implementation approach of DT until now. Widely developing DTs for the manufacturing industry is still challenging. Thus, this paper proposes a novel implementation framework of digital twins for intelligent manufacturing, denoted as IF-DTiM, which possesses several distinct merits to distinguish itself from previous works. First, IF-DTiM fully utilizes new-generation container technology so that DT-related applications and services can be packaged in a self-contained way, rapidly deployed, and robustly operated with the capabilities of failover, autoscaling, and load balancing. Second, it leverages existing intelligent cloud manufacturing services to realize the intelligence for DT externally in a scalable and plug-and-play manner instead of using traditional approaches to embed intelligence in DT. Third, IF-DTiM contains Product DT for products, Equipment DT (i.e., EQ DT) for equipment, and Process DT for production lines, which can generically fulfill the demands and scenarios to achieve intelligent manufacturing for various manufacturing industries. Testing results show that IF-DTiM can achieve remarkable performance in rapid deployment and real-time data exchanges of DT-related applications. Finally, we develop an example DTiM system for CNC machining based on IF-DTiM to demonstrate its efficacy and applicability in facilitating the manufacturing industry to build their DT systems. Note to Practitioners—Developing Digital Twin (DT) systems to realize intelligent manufacturing is challenging. The proposed IF-DTiM (Implementation Framework of Digital Twins for Intelligent Manufacturing) provides a novel container-technology and cloud-manufacturing-service-based systematic methodology for building DTiM. In this paper, we present the system architecture and several operational scenarios (e.g., how to create and use DTs) of IF-DTiM, together with the design of its core functional mechanisms (e.g., rapid deployment scheme for DT, real-time data exchange for DT, DT interface pattern, and general workflow architecture for DT). Also, an example DTiM system for CNC machining based on IF-DTiM is presented to facilitate the practitioners to adopt the designs and niches in IF-DTiM to build their desired DTiM systems.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2022.3143832","Intelligent Manufacturing Research Center (iMRC) through the Featured Areas Research Center Program within the framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in Taiwan; Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 110-2218-E-006-027,MOST 108-2221-E-034-015-MY2,MOST 110-2221-E-034-009-MY2,MOST 110-2221-E-006-124); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9697094","Implementation framework;digital twins;intelligent manufacturing;container technology","Manufacturing;Containers;Digital twin;Software;Manufacturing industries;Fourth Industrial Revolution;Cloud computing","cloud computing;computerised numerical control;containers;cyber-physical systems;intelligent manufacturing systems;machining;manufacturing industries;production engineering computing;real-time systems","cloud-manufacturing-service-based systematic methodology;DT interface pattern;novel implementation framework;intelligent manufacturing;intelligent cyber-physical integration;digital twins;new-generation container technology;IF-DTiM system;core technologies;industry 4.0;manufacturing industries;digital transformation;real-time data exchanges;CNC machining","","5","","46","IEEE","31 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is assumed that the occurrence of a reconfiguration event changes the system configuration immediately and a reconfiguration requirement is triggered randomly in the current work. For the safety of an RMS, the implementation of system reconfigurations is only permitted at some specific plant states. However, it is unreasonable to execute a system reconfiguration immediately at a reconfigurable state, when current on-going manufacturing tasks are not finished. In order to keep the continuity of production process and to avoid confusion of an RMS, a novel reconfiguration control structure based on NCESs is proposed, where a reconfiguration controller (RC) performs the implementation of reconfigurations and a task supervisor (TS) monitors the execution status of tasks. The applicability of the method is illustrated by using a simple RMS.","","978-3-907144-00-8","10.23919/ECC.2019.8796179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8796179","","","control engineering computing;discrete event systems;flexible manufacturing systems;production engineering computing","reconfigurable manufacturing systems;NCESs;supervisory control method;firing rule maximal single spontaneous transition steps;reconfiguration event changes;system configuration;reconfiguration requirement;system reconfiguration;reconfigurable state;manufacturing tasks;novel reconfiguration control structure;reconfiguration controller;supervisory control","","1","","23","","15 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is complemented by making the system transparent, which gives understanding how the manufacturing process is carried out and helps build trust in such systems. To this end, we exploit semantic technologies to represent machines' capabilities and match them to production requests, to address the question of flexibility, as well as AI planning techniques to generate production sequences.

Now in the present day, we use cloud everywhere in our life to store a huge amount of data for business and personal purposes. In the cloud, we have security mechanisms like identity, authentication, password policies but not much enough for our security terms and conditions and cloud takes more time to process real time data. Somewhere or somehow our data security is made up of the high decryption technologies or the hacking issues, so we have come up with a new technology named Fog Computing which is used for security and protection purposes mainly focusing on fog processing. By the way, Cloud and Fog are almost the same things but the Fog will remain the dominating one because it is the extended features of cloud computing. IoT is the most growing technology used to process real time data like running software, home appliances, sensors, systems, and many other network-based applications to communicate with data and decrease human effort.

Brennan","Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada; Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada","2019 IEEE 17th International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN)","30 Jan 2020","2019","1","","160","163","The IEC 61499 standard has been proposed for development of next-generation industrial automation systems to support portability, interoperability, and configurability. Compared with the traditional IEC 61131-3 standard, it provides an open reference architecture with some key features: object-oriented modeling by using function blocks as basic elements, and event-driven execution by using data/events as input/output. Recently IEC 61499 has been integrated with its enabling technologies to realize distributed intelligent automation for industrial cyber-physical systems. In this paper, two perspectives are provided through analysis of recent research: a) design paradigms for IEC 61499, including object-oriented design, component-based design, and service-oriented architecture; and b) computing paradigms for IEC 61499, including distributed intelligence, autonomic computing, and cloud computing. Future research trends are also outlined as a conclusion.","2378-363X","978-1-7281-2927-3","10.1109/INDIN41052.2019.8972153","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8972153","cyber-physical systems;distributed intelligent automation;function blocks;IEC 61499;industrial computing","","cloud computing;control engineering computing;factory automation;IEC standards;object-oriented methods;open systems;process control;production engineering computing;service-oriented architecture","distributed intelligent automation;IEC 61499 standard;next-generation industrial automation systems;IEC 61131-3 standard;industrial cyber-physical systems;object-oriented design;component-based design;distributed intelligence;service-oriented architecture;autonomic computing;cloud computing;portability;interoperability;configurability","","3","","41","IEEE","30 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The outcome of adopting DT is so encouraging that it is hoped that more than 50% of the large industries will benefit from DT by the end of 2021. Unfortunately, DT lacks a single publicly accepted narrative. In order to help researchers for building a common narrative about DT, we present an elaborated structure of DT, namely, spiral DT-framework. Furthermore, for a secure and reliable management of the DT data, we propose using the blockchain technology rather than cloud or fog. As the classical blockchain suffers from transaction confirmation delays and is vulnerable to the quantum attacks, therefore, we propose a new variant of blockchain, namely twinchain, which is quantum-resilient and offers immediate transaction confirmation. This article also presents a framework for deployment of twinchain for manufacturing of a robot surgical machine.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2020.3047840","Academic Centre of Excellence in Cyber Security Research a University of Warwick(grant numbers:EP/R007195/1); Alan Turing Institute(grant numbers:EP/N510129/1); PETRAS National Centre of Excellence for IoT Systems Cybersecurity(grant numbers:EP/S035362/1); FAIR-SPACE(grant numbers:EP/R026092/1); NRF of Korea(grant numbers:2019K1A3A1A8011295711); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9310354","Blockchain;digital twin;Industry 4.0;Internet of Things (IoT);quantum resilient","Blockchain;Spirals;Industries;Digital twin;Manufacturing;Informatics;Digital signatures","blockchains;decision making;electronic money;manufacturing processes;production engineering computing","spiral digital twin framework;twinchain;spiral DT-framework;DT data;smart manufacturing;blockchain technology;transaction confirmation delays;quantum attacks","","23","","37","IEEE","29 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
