Progress in ICT constantly drives innovations. Ubiquitous connectivity enabled by IoT technologies, increasing compute capacity and efficiency, and the subsequent push of digitalization in industry enabled new data-driven applications and the re-emergence of AI-technologies over the last decade. At the same time, the deficiencies of current infrastructures and system architectures are revealed when companies fail to adopt data-driven technologies extensively. This paper discusses how modern IT-architectures and infrastructure for cyber-physical production systems can enable their inherent self-x capabilities to pave the road towards higher levels of autonomy facilitated by data-driven technologies.","1946-0759","978-1-7281-8956-7","10.1109/ETFA46521.2020.9212182","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9212182","Cyber-physical system;Cyber-physical production system;self-x;autonomy;architecture;dynamic deployment;service orchestration","Industries;Production systems;Technological innovation;Roads;Conferences;Systems architecture;Companies","innovation management;Internet of Things;knowledge based systems;mobile computing;production engineering computing","cyber-physical production systems;AI-technologies;data-driven applications;IoT technologies;ubiquitous connectivity;Smart Manufacturing;IT-architectures;data-driven technologies;system architectures","","7","","38","IEEE","5 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Each component may be of different physical behavior with different control software. Simulation and testing on smart manufacturing systems require a software infrastructure that can orchestrate the execution of heterogenous, cyber-physical components besides modeling physical machines in respect to floorplan layouts. Automated simulation as a result is challenging and error-prone. Recent strides in formal modeling of cyber-physical systems and programming languages offer some new techniques for addressing this challenge. In this paper, we present a compositional automata-based modeling formalism and programming abstractions to design coordination logic between heterogeneous robots in different layouts. Our formalism allows us to automatically simulate and compare performance metrics for different floorplan layouts. We implement our proof-of-concept prototype with the challenging simulation environment for 2021 Agile Robotics for Industrial Automation Competition. Our experiment results demonstrate how our simulation can be used to evaluate and compare performance under different layouts and applicable for reconfiguration and virtual commissioning.","2161-8089","978-1-6654-9042-9","10.1109/CASE49997.2022.9926564","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9926564","smart manufacturing;virtual commissioning;simulation","Codes;Automation;Service robots;Robot kinematics;Layout;Programming;Cyber-physical systems","automata theory;control engineering computing;formal languages;formal specification;formal verification;manufacturing systems;mobile robots;multi-robot systems;production engineering computing","programming abstractions;smart manufacturing system;complex cyber-physical system;component machines;floorplan layout;different physical behavior;different control software;cyber-physical components;modeling physical machines;automated simulation;formal modeling;cyber-physical systems;programming languages;different layouts;different floorplan layouts;challenging simulation environment","","","","18","IEEE","28 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"A Digital Twin-based Approach Performing Integrated Process Planning and Scheduling for Service-based Production","Z. MÃ¼ller-Zhang; T. Kuhn","Department Virtual Engineering, Fraunhofer IESE, Kaiserslautern, Germany; Division Embedded System, Fraunhofer IESE, Kaiserslautern, Germany","2022 IEEE 27th International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)","25 Oct 2022","2022","","","1","8","Nowadays, the automation industry is undergoing many changes, manufactures must react to fast changing market demands and more individual customer requirements. Recept-based, Service-Oriented Architectures enable the efficient adaption of production processes to new operating conditions. However, to ensure production performance, service-oriented production should also be complemented by adequate scheduling approaches to guarantee critical performance factors. We present a Digital Twin-based approach that performs integrated process planning and scheduling for service-based production. For our approach, we have identified a common set of input data required for integrated process planning and scheduling. We use Deep-Q-Network, which is a deep Reinforcement Learning method, to derive near optimal schedules for production conditions described in Digital Twins. If an unforseen event happens during the production, our approach is able to adapt current schedules to the changed operating conditions. The case study shows that our approach is able to derive near optimal schedules for customized products and adapt its currents schedules for new orders with different production goals.","","978-1-6654-9996-5","10.1109/ETFA52439.2022.9921643","Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9921643","Digital Twin;Smart Manufacturing;Process Planning;Scheduling;Reinforcement Learning","Industries;Schedules;Job shop scheduling;Process planning;Optimal scheduling;Reinforcement learning;Service-oriented architecture","learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;process planning;production engineering computing;scheduling;service-oriented architecture;software architecture","customized products;currents schedules;different production goals;Digital Twin-based approach performing integrated process planning;service-based production;fast changing market demands;individual customer requirements;Service-Oriented Architectures;production processes;service-oriented production;adequate scheduling approaches;critical performance factors;performs integrated process planning;optimal schedules;production conditions;Digital Twins;current schedules;changed operating conditions","","","","26","IEEE","25 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
