Very large number of intelligent sensors are being available generating an exploding amount of data. Several issues come with the big data in real industry, including the a grand-scale connected network construction with the data security and access protocol issues, data quality with considerable noise when gathered from industrial factories, efficient data storage, smart interconnection with cloud services, and real-time analytics requirements. This paper proposes an integrated CPS based architecture for smart manufacturing and provides the deployment details, addressing all the potential problems in an appropriate way. It has been successfully implemented in a real industry environment, and won the Best Industry Application of IoT at the BigInsights Data & AI Innovation Awards.","","978-1-5386-8500-6","10.1109/ICPHYS.2019.8780271","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8780271","Cyber-Physical System;Internet of Things;Industry 4.0;cloud computing;big data ecosystem;data quality","Big Data;Manufacturing;Industries;Sensors;Data integrity;Real-time systems;Cloud computing","Big Data;cloud computing;cyber-physical systems;data analysis;Internet of Things;production engineering computing;real-time systems;security of data","industrial Cyber Physical System;smart manufacturing environment;big data;data security;access protocol issues;data quality;industrial factories;data storage;industry Internet of Things;industry Cyber-Physical System;cloud services;real-time analytics;CPS based architecture","","15","","14","IEEE","1 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When work changes, the system has to be reprogrammed and the robot needs to follow a specific trajectory to finish the pick and place task. Therefore, it is urgent to find a convenient, and feature reserved teaching method that could adapt to different pick and place tasks. This paper introduces a novel teaching method for the pick-place system under the robot operating system(ROS) without losing valuable features during the human demonstration. This teaching method utilizes only one depth camera to continuously track the object’s 3D position without any marker attached. The 6D pose of the object at the endpoint is estimated to provide extra orientation information. Then, generating the executable path by trajectory key features extraction algorithm and pick-place pose adjustment planning. The robot could follow the path generated to imitate the demonstrated pick-place task. The experiments prove that this teaching method is efficient. The system could not only adapt to the different object’s initial positions but also reserve the key features in teaching.","","978-1-6654-0535-5","10.1109/ROBIO54168.2021.9739365","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9739365","","Three-dimensional displays;Image color analysis;Shape;Service robots;Operating systems;Education;Feature extraction","educational robots;feature extraction;industrial manipulators;object tracking;operating systems (computers);production engineering computing;robot programming;robot vision;teaching","6D pose;feature reserved teaching method;flexible manufacturing;industry 4.0;one depth camera;pick-place pose adjustment planning;robot operating system;ROS;trajectory key features extraction algorithm","","","","13","IEEE","28 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Big Data have immense transformational potential, manufacturing companies are in a race to implement IoT-based solutions to innovate, improve productivity, reduce costs, and improve their market share. As companies try to embrace IoT, one of the key challenges that they face is to come up with an “Integrated Approach.”“Integrated Approach”includes fitting IoT in the overall system landscape, selecting the right use case, and evaluating and deciding on implementation approach. This paper provides guidance to transform legacy manufacturing unit to a smart factory conforming to Industry 4.0 principles. It presents a reference architecture and offers various practical approaches for consideration to embark on digital journey. It details each approach along with its own benefits and challenges and helps organizations to realistically determine faster time-to-market versus its long-term goals. This paper attempts to perform a deep dive on various aspects of integrated approach which will be immensely helpful for organizations and researchers alike.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2872799","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8478188","Big data;cloud;edge computing;data integration;Internet of Things;PaaS;Smart factory","Sensors;Smart manufacturing;Production facilities;Computer architecture;Real-time systems;Big Data","Big Data;data analysis;factory automation;Internet of Things;manufacturing systems;production engineering computing;production facilities","smart factory transition;digital transformation;IoT-based solutions;legacy manufacturing unit;Big Data;edge analytics;Internet-of-Things;Industry 4.0","","46","","9","OAPA","30 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We analyse the academic articles within the Smart Factory literature. Smart Factory, in the context of Industry 4.0 and the IoT, is currently one of the most discussed topics in industrial manufacturing research. Scholars agree that the implementation of Smart Factory leads to the creation of value. We identify a research gap which is related to the make-or-buy decision around some core components of the Smart Factory, especially the Digital Twin (DT). We argue that the effectiveness of value creation depends on the ""way"" in which Smart Factory is implemented. Firms are required to decide if an implementation project will be executed in-house or through external supplier. In addition, we analysed the research gap through the theoretical lens of Transaction Costs Economics (TCE).","","978-1-7281-3401-7","10.1109/ICE.2019.8792577","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8792577","smart factory;smart factory implementation;systematic literature review","Smart manufacturing;Computer architecture;Bibliographies;Middleware;Economics;Cloud computing;Industries","costing;decision making;industrial economics;Internet of Things;organisational aspects;production engineering computing;production facilities;reviews;value engineering","smart factory literature;literature review;Industry 4.0;IoT;industrial manufacturing research;make-or-buy decision;digital twin;firms;transaction costs economics;value creation","","6","","50","IEEE","12 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
