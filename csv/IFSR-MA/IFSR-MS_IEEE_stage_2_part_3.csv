Smart manufacturing promises to improve these aspects. One key approach that is being pursued in this context is the creation of centralized software-defined control (SDC) architectures and strategies that use diverse sensors and data sources to make manufacturing more adaptive, resilient, and programmable. In this paper, we present SDCWorks-a modeling and simulation framework for SDC. It consists of the semantic structures for creating models, a baseline controller, and an open source implementation of a discrete event simulator for SDCWorks models. We provide the semantics of such a manufacturing system in terms of a discrete transition system which sets up the platform for future research in a new class of problems in formal verification, synthesis, and monitoring. We illustrate the expressive power of SDCWorks by modeling the realistic SMART manufacturing testbed of University of Michigan. We show how our open source SDCWorks simulator can be used to evaluate relevant metrics (throughput, latency, and load) for example manufacturing systems.","","978-1-5386-5301-2","10.1109/ICCPS.2018.00017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8443724","cyber physical systems;manufacturing;verification","Manufacturing systems;Adaptation models;Analytical models;Cost accounting;Smart manufacturing;Computer architecture","control engineering computing;cyber-physical systems;discrete event simulation;discrete event systems;formal verification;manufacturing systems;production engineering computing","software defined control;smart manufacturing systems;discrete manufacturing systems;complex cyber-physical systems;diverse sensors;data sources;semantic structures;baseline controller;discrete event simulator;discrete transition system;formal verification;open source SDCWorks simulator;University of Michigan","","7","","31","IEEE","23 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This article focuses specifically on the fault tolerance to controller failures (as it is the most complex challenge) aiming at redistributing the responsibilities at runtime in order to finish the current production plan. Its applicability is illustrated by means of a case study that consists of a reconfigurable control application based on the IEC 61131-3 for a flexible assembly cell. A prototype software tool guides the developer during the development process. This approach contributes to develop more flexible control systems because they can react in case of a controller failure, to increase the system availability during its operation and to reduce the production downtimes to perform the maintenance tasks.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2019.2925837","Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea(grant numbers:GIU18/162); Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades(grant numbers:RTI2018-096116-B-I00); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8765797","Industrial automation;IEC 61131-3;methodology for industrial automation systems (MeiA ${}_{\scriptsize\bullet}$ );reconfigurable control applications","Control systems;Automation;Production;IEC Standards;Runtime;Software;Process control","assembling;control systems;controllers;failure analysis;fault tolerance;flexible manufacturing systems;IEC standards;industrial control;maintenance engineering;production planning;prototypes;software tools","reconfigurable automation systems;industrial control systems;system reconfiguration;system design time;fault tolerance;controller failure;production plan;reconfigurable control application;IEC 61131-3;flexible assembly cell;prototype software tool guides;flexible control systems;maintenance tasks;downtime reduction","","3","","27","CCBY","18 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Compared with the traditional IEC 61131-3 standard, it provides an open reference architecture with some key features-object-oriented modeling by using function blocks as basic elements and event-driven execution by using data/events as inputs/outputs. In order to make IEC 61499 more applicable in industrial practices, researchers have been focusing on its transformation methods, modeling techniques, and implementation tools over the past years. In this article, three major issues are discussed through analysis of recent research: 1) how existing systems programmed in IEC 61131-3 can be transitioned to IEC 61499-based systems; 2) how IEC 61499 has integrated with enabling technologies for distributed intelligent automation; and 3) how engineering environments for IEC 61499 have been implemented. In detail, the article starts with challenges in the transition to and methods of transformation to IEC 61499-based systems, goes further into design and computing paradigms for IEC 61499 function block modeling, and ends with developments and applications of IEC 61499 engineering environments.

DTs have been in use for years in areas such as model-based process control and predictive maintenance, however moving forward a framework is needed that will support the expected pervasiveness of DT technology in the evolution of SM or I4.0. A set of requirements for a DT framework has been derived from analysis of DT definitions, DTs in use today, expected DT applications in the near future, and longer-term DT trends and the DT vision in SM. These requirements include elements of re-usability, interoperability, interchangeability, maintainability, extensibility, and autonomy across the entire DT lifecycle. A baseline framework for DT technology has been developed that addresses many aspects of these requirements and enables the addressing of the requirements more fully through additional specification. The baseline framework includes a definition of a DT and an object-oriented (O-O) architecture for DTs that defines generalization, aggregation and instantiation of DT classes. Case studies using and extending the baseline framework illustrate its advantages in supporting DT solutions and trends in SM.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3000437","National Science Foundation (NSF); National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)(grant numbers:70NANB19H090); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9109299","Digital twin;industry 40;modeling;prediction;smart manufacturing","Digital twin;Market research;Industries;Smart manufacturing;Process control;Predictive models","aggregation;condition monitoring;design engineering;maintenance engineering;manufacturing systems;open systems;process control;production engineering computing","digital twin framework;smart manufacturing;biggest technology trend;design today;model-based process control;predictive maintenance;DT technology;aggregation;object-oriented architecture;maintainability;interchangeability;interoperability;Industry 4.0;baseline framework","","75","","105","CCBY","5 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In recent research projects, a skill-based architecture has been introduced and presented within an industrial demonstrator proposing the required adaptivity. Within this work, the skill-based architecture is compared to a more traditional component-based hierarchical approach to identify strength and weakness of this approach, which then enables further improvements of the skill-based architecture. The flexibility of control software can not directly be measured. Therefore execution time, modularity, readability, and reusability considering the impact of component exchanges are used as evaluation criteria. Modularity and reusability are measured by the number of needed Function Blocks (FBs) and that can also be used for other systems respectively. To evaluate readability three derived metrics from the basic Halstead Metric are used. The comparison shows that the skill-based architecture is more complex but much more flexible than the more traditional component-based hierarchical approach.","1946-0759","978-1-7281-0303-7","10.1109/ETFA.2019.8869050","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8869050","","Computer architecture;Automation;Belts;Robot kinematics;Software","control engineering computing;distributed control;factory automation;object-oriented programming;production engineering computing;software metrics","skill-based control architecture;flexible automation systems;control software;component-based hierarchical approach;customized products;industrial demonstrator;function blocks;FB;basic Halstead metric","","9","","23","IEEE","17 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
