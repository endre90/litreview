VC is getting increasingly integrated into the overall engineering process, where the control software is continuously tested with the virtual plant model. At the same time, collaborative and intelligent automation systems are becoming an important part of modern industries. In these complex systems, humans perform operations together with collaborative robots, intelligent machines and smart tools. However, performing VC of such complex, distributed and heterogeneous systems demands new ways of interfacing different hardware and software components. This paper discusses the requirements, process and results of integrated virtual commissioning of an industrial collaborative and intelligent automation system use-case. Moreover, this industrial use-case illustrates challenges and exemplifies the need to use the next generation Robot Operating System (ROS2) due to its robust communication layer as well as easy integration with smart devices and algorithms.","1946-0759","978-1-7281-0303-7","10.1109/ETFA.2019.8869444","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8869444","virtual commissioning;robot operating system;factory automation;control and communication architecture;intelligent automation;collaborative robot systems;human-in-the-loop","Robots;Collaboration;Control systems;Automation;Engines;Solid modeling;Tools","control engineering computing;mobile robots;multi-robot systems;production engineering computing;robot programming;software tools","virtual plant model;collaborative automation systems;intelligent automation systems;collaborative robots;intelligent machines;hardware components;software components;integrated virtual commissioning;intelligent automation system use-case;ROS2;system delivery;integration requirements;engineering process;control software;robot operating system;industrial use case;industrial collaborative automation systems;distributed systems demands;complex systems demands;smart tools;smart devices;robust communication layer","","11","","28","IEEE","17 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Model-driven engineering methods are often linked with the development and deployment of distributed automation systems. However, most legacy systems currently do not have a system-level model or even source code, which hinders the maintenance of future-proof systems. With a huge amount of operation data collected by acquisition processes in the existing industrial systems, the system behavior model can be recovered but in an effective way. This paper proposes an automatic software behavior model recovery method based on data mining from industrial controllers. This method can recover and optimize the system models based on the state machines and largely reduce the computing power required for generating a system behavior state machine model. Finally, the proposed method was verified by the FSM model inferring and code generation using a color sorter example.","2378-363X","978-1-7281-4964-6","10.1109/INDIN45582.2020.9442085","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9442085","Model Drive Engineering;Code Recovery;Finite state machine (FSM);Reverse Engineering (RE);Data Mining","Computational modeling;Cyber-physical systems;Maintenance engineering;Software;Data models;Model driven engineering;Manufacturing","control engineering computing;cyber-physical systems;data mining;finite state machines;flexible manufacturing systems;industrial control;production engineering computing;program compilers;software maintenance","model-driven engineering methods;distributed automation systems;legacy systems;system-level model;future-proof systems;industrial systems;system behavior model;automatic software behavior model recovery method;industrial controllers;system models;system behavior state machine model;code generation;automatic software behavior model generation method;flexible manufacturing;industrial cyber-physical systems","","","","17","IEEE","7 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since Microservices Architecture is a new paradigm in service-oriented systems, an in-depth analysis from the industrial automation perspective is necessary in order to figure out why and how this new architecture could be helpful to build flexible automation systems. In this paper we first clearly describe and characterize the Microservices Architecture. We next discuss an existing paradox in microservice granularity, and suggest an approach to solve the mentioned paradox. Then we compare this new approach to the Service Oriented Architecture, highlight the key (dis)advantages of utilizing Microservice Architecture in building flexible automation systems that fits in 4th industrial revolution needs, and describe the challenges to its future adoption.","2378-363X","978-1-7281-2927-3","10.1109/INDIN41052.2019.8972079","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8972079","Automation;Microservices;Granularity;Flexibility;Production;Function Block","","agile manufacturing;flexible manufacturing systems;product development;production engineering computing;service-oriented architecture","flexible automation systems;advanced manufacturing systems;product development;production scenarios;agile automation systems;industrial automation systems;service-oriented systems;microservice granularity;microservice architecture;service oriented architecture;plug & produce;4th industrial revolution","","10","","35","IEEE","30 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One common aim of these strategies is to achieve smart manufacturing, which demands the interoperation, integration, and fusion of the physical world and the cyber world of manufacturing. As well, New IT [such as Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, big data, mobile Internet, and cyber-physical systems (CPS)] have played pivotal roles in promoting smart manufacturing. Data generated in the physical world can be sensed and transfered to the cyber world through IoT and the Internet, and be processed and analyzed by cloud computing, big data technologies to adjust the physical world. The physical world and the cyber world of manufacturing are integrated based on CPS. On the other hand, servitization has become a prominent trend in the manufacturing. Embracing the concept of “Manufacturing-as-a-Service,” manufacturing is provided as service for users. Because of the characteristics of interoperability and platform independence, services pave the way for large-scale smart applications and manufacturing collaboration. Combining New IT and services, this paper proposes a framework-New IT driven service-oriented smart manufacturing (SoSM). SoSM aims at facilitating the visions of smart manufacturing by making full use of New IT and services.
