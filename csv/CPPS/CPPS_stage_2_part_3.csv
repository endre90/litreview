"An Integrated Design Method For Cyber-Physical Production Systems","G. Wan; P. Wang; L. Xue; P.

Although the proposed model-driven engineering (MDE) is applied to industrial automation for this issue, the inherent complex dependencies and constraints between models and the availability of suitable tools for code generation limit the application of the model-driven approach in practice, especially as the system becomes more enormous. The component-based design (CBD) approach, which is a bottom-up approach, in contrast to the MDE that is top-down, is proposed to manage the complexity of software aspect based on the idea that building a system from existing components instead of the scratch. However, CBD can't provide the whole system model, so other ways should be adopted to design the system structure in advance. This paper presents an integrated design approach based on the combination of CBD and MDE to realize auto-design for cyber-physical production systems.","2381-0947","978-1-5386-4509-3","10.1109/IAEAC.2018.8577518","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8577518","Component-based Design;IEC 61499;Industrial automation;Model-based design;Ontology;Semantic technology","Unified modeling language;Automation;Control systems;Software;Ontologies;Testing;Integrated design","cyber-physical systems;manufacturing systems;object-oriented programming;production engineering computing;software engineering","system design;MDE;industrial automation;model-driven approach;component-based design approach;CBD;system model;system structure;integrated design approach;auto-design;integrated design method;industrial cyber-physical production system;software programming;model-driven engineering","","1","","24","IEEE","16 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Aligned with CPS, the adoption of production system architectures is suitable to reduce complexity and achieve interoperability in the industrial applications. In this context, the Reference Architecture Model for Industry 4.0 (RAMI4.0) provides the guidelines to develop Industry 4.0 (I4.0) compliant solutions, considering the existing industrial standards. The so-called I4.0 components implement this model in practice, combining the physical asset with its digital representation, named Asset Administration Shell (AAS). This paper explores the use of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) to implement the AAS functionalities, taking advantage of their inherits characteristics, e.g., autonomy, intelligence, decentralization and reconfigurability. In this context, the mapping between AAS functionalities and MAS characteristics is provided, as well as the challenges for this implementation. The applicability is illustrated by digitalizing an inspection cell comprising an UR3 robot and several console products by using MAS technology.","","978-1-7281-6389-5","10.1109/ICPS48405.2020.9274745","Interreg; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9274745","Asset Administration Shell;I4.0 component;Multi-Agent Systems;RAMI4.0","Computer architecture;Standards;Industries;Interoperability;Business;IEC Standards;Digital representation","factory automation;manufacturing systems;multi-agent systems;production engineering computing","reconfigurable manufacturing systems;cyber-physical systems;production system architectures;reference architecture model;asset administration shell;multiagent systems;MAS technology;industry 4.0 components;industrial standards","","9","","24","IEEE","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
