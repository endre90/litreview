Cyber-physical systems, Internet-of-Things (IoT), and Cloud computing, play a key role in the fourth industrial revolution known as Industry 4.0. The microservice architecture has evolved as an alternative to SOA and promises to address many of the challenges in software development. In this paper, we adopt the concept of microservice and describe a framework for manufacturing systems that has the cyber-physical microservice as the key construct. The manufacturing plant processes are defined as compositions of primitive cyber-physical microservices adopting either the orchestration or the choreography pattern. IoT technologies are used for system integration and model-driven engineering is utilized to semi-automate the development process for the industrial engineer, who is not familiar with microservices and IoT. Two case studies demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.","","978-1-5386-6531-2","10.1109/ICPHYS.2018.8387665","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8387665","cyber-physical systems;microservices;IoT;service discovery;service composition;UML4IoT;semantic web","Manufacturing systems;Computer architecture;Cyber-physical systems;Industries;Software;Scalability","cloud computing;industrial engineering;Internet of Things;manufacturing industries;manufacturing systems;production engineering computing;service-oriented architecture","cyber-physical microservice;IoT;manufacturing industry;cyber-physical systems;fourth industrial revolution;microservice architecture;manufacturing plant processes;system integration;model-driven engineering;industrial engineer;microservices;manufacturing systems;Internet-of-Things;cloud computing;Industry 4.0;software development;choreography pattern","","46","","43","IEEE","21 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we propose generic autonomic management as a service and show how it can be integrated in the Arrowhead framework.

This new trend in industrial manufacturing offers new automation possibilities with the goal to optimize operational efficiency, minimize costs and realize new business models. However, accompanied with those new opportunities, on the other hand engineering such systems and their architectures has become a complex and difficult task. Having recognized this issue, the Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) has been introduced in order to provide viewpoints for structuring an Industry 4.0 based system according to the different concerns to address. Although providing a standardized framework, at the current point of view it is difficult to describe a detailed system architecture, since this reference model is missing formalizations and common methods. Therefore, this paper proposes a possibility of aligning the model-based engineering methods introduced by the Software Platform Embedded Systems (SPES) with the architectural concepts of RAMI 4.0 in order to close the aforementioned gap and provide well-defined methodology in order to develop current and future industrial systems. To achieve this, similarities between both approaches are analyzed and compared with each other and a architecture definition based on the ISO 42010 is given, which is subsequently evaluated by the application of a real-world case study.","","978-1-7281-6389-5","10.1109/ICPS48405.2020.9274701","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9274701","System Architecture;Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT);Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0);Domain-specific Systems Engineering (DSSE);Software Platform Embedded Systems (SPES)","Modeling;Computer architecture;Industries;Unified modeling language;Solid modeling;Business;Biological system modeling","architecture;cost reduction;cyber-physical systems;embedded systems;Internet of Things;ISO standards;manufacturing systems;production engineering computing","reference architecture model industrie 4.0;detailed system architecture;model-based engineering methods;software platform embedded systems;architectural concepts;manufacturing systems;Cyber-physical Systems;fourth industrial revolution;business models;industrial Internet of Things applications;cost reduction;standardized framework;ISO 42010 standard","","","","26","IEEE","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we combine the performance of centralized optimization algorithms with the resilience of a decentralized consensus. We propose a novel autonomous system architecture for CPPS featuring an automatic production plan generation, a functional validation, and a two-stage consensus algorithm, combining a majority vote on safety and optimality, and a unanimous vote on feasibility and authenticity.

The design principles to build distributed event-driven applications are known to be complex and hard to handle at the application code level. As a result, there are several already well-known patterns that aim to provide a convenient solution and abstract the business logic development from the underlying architecture complexities. This paper proposes a common framework that addresses all the needs of an in-production application, that are hard to solve under the event-driven paradigm.

Industrial agents have become a common solution for this issue because their features fulfil several of the requirements for the development of AASs.

In this context, this work contributes a pattern for the implementation of AASs based on industrial agents from which agent templates for different applications can be derived.

However, many digital-twin-related approaches, found in industries as well as literature, mainly focus on modelling individual physical things with high-fidelity methods with limited scalability. In this paper, we introduce a digital-twin architecture called TiLA (Twin-in-the-Loop Architecture). TiLA employs heterogeneous models and online data to create a digital twin, which follows a Globally Asynchronous Locally Synchronous (GALS) model of computation. It facilitates the creation of a scalable digital twin with different levels of modelling abstraction as well as giving GALS formalism for execution strategy. Furthermore, TiLA provides facilities to develop applications around the twin as well as an interface to synchronise the twin with the physical system through an industrial communication protocol. A digital twin for a manufacturing line has been developed as a case study using TiLA. It demonstrates the use of digital twin models together with online data for monitoring and analysing failures in the physical system.","2576-6996","978-1-5386-6648-7","10.1109/ICCD46524.2019.00019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8988620","Digital twin;Cyber-physical system;Globally Asynchronous Locally Synchronous","","artificial intelligence;control engineering computing;factory automation;production engineering computing;protocols;software engineering;synchronisation","TiLA;twin-in-the-loop architecture;cyber-physical production systems;digital-twin-related approaches;modelling individual physical things;digital-twin architecture;scalable digital twin;physical system;digital twin models;virtual replica;Globally Asynchronous Locally Synchronous model;GALS formalism;execution strategy;industrial communication protocol;manufacturing line","","9","","25","IEEE","10 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, Industry 4.0 is the technological evolution of embedded systems applied to Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). With this, a shift from the current paradigm of centralization to a more decentralized production, supported by Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), is implied. The work reported in this paper focuses on the development of smart devices (SmartBoxes), based on low-cost hardware such as Raspberry Pi and also platforms certified for industrial applications, such as NI CompactRIO. Both platforms adopted the OPC-UA architecture to collect data from the shop-floor and convert it into OPC-UA Data Access standard for further integration in the proposed CPPS. Tests were also performed with the MQTT protocol for monitorization. Each SmartBox is capable of real-time applications that run on OPC-UA and MQTT, allowing easy interaction between supervisory systems and physical assets.","2687-6817","978-1-7281-3815-2","10.1109/RTSI.2019.8895553","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8895553","Cyber-Physical Production Systems;IIoT;OPC-UA;MQTT;SmartBox;RAMI4.0","","cyber-physical systems;Internet of Things;manufacturing systems;production engineering computing;protocols","intelligent devices;digital ecosystems;value chain;embedded systems;smart devices;low-cost hardware;OPC-UA architecture;cyber-physical production systems;industrial processes digitalization;smartboxes;Industry 4.0 paradigm;industrial Internet of Things;NI CompactRIO;shop-floor;MQTT protocol","","3","","14","IEEE","11 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To be able to cope with the high production diversities and the frequent demand changes of the market, enterprises tend to implement modular manufacturing processes. In this type of intelligent processes, robotic cells are usually integrated to perform complex manipulation and transportation tasks. New generation industrial robots are built incorporating special processing units which can operate under embedded software. This characteristic allows robots to be compatible with the automation standard IEC-61499. It proposes a generic distributed architecture for the generation of flexible and modular production systems, with the requirement of using controller devices which can work under an embedded software. This paper proposes the development of a low-cost robotic controller compatible with IEC-61499. The system is based on the use of a robotic cell to wield elements in a modular manufacturing line. The cell is composed by a YouBot Robotic Arm operating under the control of the development board Raspberry Pi 3B.","","978-1-5386-6657-9","10.1109/ETCM.2018.8580338","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8580338","Robotic Manipulator;IEC-61499;Modular Manufacturing;Industry 4.0;Robot Operating System (ROS)","Service robots;Standards;Manipulators;Task analysis;Computer architecture","control engineering computing;cyber-physical systems;design engineering;IEC standards;industrial manipulators;industrial robots;manufacturing systems;mobile robots;production engineering computing;public domain software","industrial robot control;embedded software;automation standard IEC-61499;controller devices;YouBot Robotic Arm;flexible cyber-physical production systems architecture design;modular manufacturing process","","4","","18","IEEE","20 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two key technological enablers to achieve the flexibility and efficiency sought for factories of the future are the communication networks and the data management schemes that will support connectivity and data distribution in Cyber-Physical Production Systems. Communications and data management must be built upon a flexible and reliable architecture to be able to efficiently meet the stringent and varying requirements in terms of latency, reliability and data rates demanded by industrial applications, and with particular attention on time-critical automation. To this aim, this paper proposes the use of heterogeneous communication technologies integrated in a hierarchical communications and data management architecture where decentralized and local management decisions are coordinated by a central orchestrator that ensures the efficient global operation of the system. Industrial applications are organized in different tiers where different management strategies are applied to satisfy their different requirements in terms of latency and reliability. The use of virtualization and softwarization technologies as RAN Slicing and Cloud RAN will allow to achieve the flexibility, scalability and adaptation capabilities required to support the high-demanding and diverse industrial environment.","","978-3-903176-01-0","10.23919/WONS.2018.8311660","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8311660","Industry 40;Factories of the Future;Communication Architecture;Data Management;Industrial Wireless Networks;Hierarchical;Decentralized;5G","Industries;Production facilities;Wireless networks;5G mobile communication;Motion control;Condition monitoring;Augmented reality","cloud computing;cyber-physical systems;production engineering computing;radio access networks;software radio;telecommunication network reliability;virtualisation","Industry 4.0 paradigm;software defined hierarchical communication;virtualization technology;softwarization technology;RAN slicing;cloud RAN;local management decisions;decentralized management decisions;heterogeneous communication technologies;industrial applications;data rates;reliability;reliable architecture;flexible architecture;Cyber-Physical Production Systems;data distribution;connectivity;data management schemes;communication networks;networked structures;digitalized structures;industrial revolution;data management architecture;hierarchical communication;diverse industrial environment;high-demanding environment","","15","","28","","12 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
