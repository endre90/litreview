Driven by the integration of cyber-physical systems and the thereby resulting autonomy of its single components, organizing the interplay of its physical counterparts becomes more and more challenging. In order to structure and realize such an industrial system in a collaborative manner, the Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) has been developed. However, although being widely accepted by the community, the standardized architecture is missing actual industrial applications. A major reason for this issue might be missing specifications in the standard itself, hindering the mutual development of such a critical infrastructure at the right level of detail. Thus, in order to counteract the mentioned problem, this work delineates the alignment of RAMI 4.0 with a well-established framework for specifying enterprise architectures, named The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF). By coalescing the system development concepts of RAMI 4.0 and TOGAF, both of the approaches could benefit from each other.

It requires process domain-specific knowledge and a service-oriented approach to be able to design a requirement-specific solution. Previous software design methods for CPPS have several drawbacks. Either these insufficiently take into account the properties of distributed systems or, in the case of Domain-Specific Languages (DSL), their focus lies on interaction logic rather than on production-specific specialties. Similarly, the possibilities for using information from the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) have so far not been integrated. Therefore, we propose a new service-oriented hierarchical DSL consisting of layers with different levels of abstraction, allowing successive and distributed software design with different degrees of detail. Hence, both process engineers and software engineers can work together during the software developing process. By incorporating information from the AAS, a static and also dynamic parameterization of the individual DSL services becomes possible. Finally, a case-study in the field of process engineering demonstrates the advantages and the applicability of the proposed approach.","","978-1-7281-2989-1","10.1109/ETFA45728.2021.9613428","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9613428","domain-specific language (DSL);asset administration shells (AAS);industrial automation systems;service oriented architecture (SOA);system modeling;cyber-physical production systems (CPPS)","Industries;Production systems;Software design;Conferences;Computer architecture;Software;DSL","cyber-physical systems;formal specification;production engineering computing;security of data;software architecture;specification languages","CPPS;automation software;process domain-specific knowledge;service-oriented approach;software design methods;distributed systems;production-specific specialties;service-oriented hierarchical DSL;distributed software design;process engineers;software engineers;software developing process;process engineering;distributed architecture;cyber-physical production systems integrating asset administration shells;hierarchical domain-specific language;AAS","","1","","24","IEEE","30 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this problem, in this article, we propose a codesign method that considers the design spaces of architecture, control, and scheduling as monolithic, mixed discrete-continuous spaces. We formulate DSE as an optimization problem and propose a generic iterative algorithm schema involving simulation in the loop to solve the abovementioned new problem.

As the interplay of those Cyber-physical Systems (CPS) itself forms a System of Systems (SoS), engineering such a system becomes a difficult task. This is mainly attributed to the evolutionary development of its independently operating components, which results in some kind of unpredictable and often undesirable behavior. Considering this from a developer’s perspective, it is important to investigate the system’s behaviors before its actual implementation. However, as methods applied in Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) have proven to be a major technology driver when it comes to developing the architecture of these industrial systems, their simulation is still not standardized. Thus, this paper introduces an Industry 4.0 specific tool-chain enabling the co-simulation of components within any developed industrial system architecture. This allows the investigation of varying industrial CPS and their interplay during run-time with the goal to detect undesired emergent behaviors. By doing so, the model is developed regarding the specifications of the Reference Architecture Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0), while Mosaik is the tool of choice for creating the Co-Simulation environment. In order to validate the developed tool-chain, a case study utilizing modular production units within an industrial automation system is applied.","2687-8828","978-1-6654-3168-2","10.1109/ISSE51541.2021.9582531","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9582531","System Architecture;Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT);Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0);Industrial Systems Engineering;Co-Simulation","Industries;Systems architecture;Production;Tools;Cyber-physical systems;Modeling;Task analysis","cyber-physical systems;factory automation;intelligent manufacturing systems;Internet of Things;production engineering computing;systems engineering","industrial automation system;modular production units;intelligent manufacturing components;cyber-physical systems;evolutionary development;model based systems engineering;industrial system architecture;industrial CPS;Reference Architecture Industrie 4.0;RAMI 4.0;model-based co-simulation;Industrial Internet of Things;IIoT;system of systems;SoS;MBSE;Industry 4.0;manufacturing systems;Mosaik","","","","29","IEEE","28 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Alongside the interaction of participants at the physical level exists another level of interactions at the software level: the distributed software architecture of the cyber-physical production system (CPPS). Contemporary CPPSs require frequent changes in communication paths and the signals communicated (i.e., rewiring) to flexibly adapt to changing production needs and environmental conditions. The integration of shopfloor participants and their wiring, hence, becomes a critical aspect of a dynamically adaptable production system. Here, incomplete and incorrect wiring is a major source of errors. To this end, this paper presents a light weight approach for wiring shopfloor participants that utilizes decentralized wiring information to extract/recover the distributed software architecture of the CPPS. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on a lab-scale production cell model.","","978-1-7281-5730-6","10.1109/ICIT46573.2021.9453697","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9453697","software architecture;reconfiguration;cyber-physical production systems;adaptability;OPC UA","Wiring;Production systems;Software architecture;Microprocessors;Unified modeling language;Computer architecture;Software","cyber-physical systems;environmental factors;floors;production engineering computing;production management;software architecture;wiring","wiring shopfloor participants;wiring information;distributed software architecture;lab-scale production cell model;dynamically wiring CPPS software architectures;modern cyber-physical production systems;software-intensive integration;signals communication;environmental conditions;light weight approach","","1","","27","IEEE","18 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Progress in ICT constantly drives innovations. Ubiquitous connectivity enabled by IoT technologies, increasing compute capacity and efficiency, and the subsequent push of digitalization in industry enabled new data-driven applications and the re-emergence of AI-technologies over the last decade. At the same time, the deficiencies of current infrastructures and system architectures are revealed when companies fail to adopt data-driven technologies extensively. This paper discusses how modern IT-architectures and infrastructure for cyber-physical production systems can enable their inherent self-x capabilities to pave the road towards higher levels of autonomy facilitated by data-driven technologies.","1946-0759","978-1-7281-8956-7","10.1109/ETFA46521.2020.9212182","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9212182","Cyber-physical system;Cyber-physical production system;self-x;autonomy;architecture;dynamic deployment;service orchestration","Industries;Production systems;Technological innovation;Roads;Conferences;Systems architecture;Companies","innovation management;Internet of Things;knowledge based systems;mobile computing;production engineering computing","cyber-physical production systems;AI-technologies;data-driven applications;IoT technologies;ubiquitous connectivity;Smart Manufacturing;IT-architectures;data-driven technologies;system architectures","","7","","38","IEEE","5 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The objective of the hierarchical modeling and simulation is to achieve the integration of all data and simulation results in a common interface. Different simulation tools have to be integrated in a common user environment, which is normally a very difficult and exhaustive work. A Meta-model framework is developed, using a combination of traditional simulation and cosimulation approaches and helps to define the linkage of different system levels. Finally an implementation of a demonstrator (robot packaging system) consisting of three different physical models with different levels of detailing, implemented in different software tools is shown. The implemented demonstrator consists of a conveyor belt which is powered by an induction motor and a robot arm which is used for palletizing bags.","","978-1-5386-5413-2","10.1109/REM.2018.8421784","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8421784","Mechatronic Design;Cyber-Physical Production System;Hierarchical Modelling;Meta-Model;Robot packaging System","Mechatronics;Mathematical model;Robots;Data models;Belts;Production systems;Tools","conveyors;cyber-physical systems;design engineering;hierarchical systems;manufacturing systems;palletising;production engineering computing","robot packaging system;hierarchical modeling;hierarchical meta-model;cyber-physical production system;user environment;software tools;conveyor belt;robot arm;palletizing bags","","2","","17","IEEE","30 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
