"Generating ROS-based Software for Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems from UML/MARTE","M. A.

For that, the Aspect-oriented Model Driven Engineering for Real-Time systems (AMoDE-RT) design approach has been extended in order to support the C++ code generation using the semantics and libraries available in ROS framework which is widely used in both academia and industry to implement the embedded software for robotic systems. The system architecture, behavior, requirements and constraints are specified in a UML/MARTE model. The information specified in the high-level model is used as input for a tool that generates a great part of the embedded software for all distributed computing devices. The main goal is to foster the use of Model-Driven Engineering in the context of cyber-physical systems design aiming the rapid prototyping via simulation and also the generation of the actual implementation of the system components. The proposed approach has been validated through a case study that demonstrates the feasibility to implement a ROS/C++ software for industrial systems. The results indicate that the proposed approach can be applied to complex systems comprising a larger number of interacting devices, whereas keeping the high-level of abstraction for system specification in UML/MARTE models.","1946-0759","978-1-7281-8956-7","10.1109/ETFA46521.2020.9212077","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9212077","Model-Driven Engineering;embedded software;code generation;UML;MARTE;Robot Operating System","Service robots;Computational modeling;Operating systems;Unified modeling language;Semantics;Systems architecture;Cyber-physical systems","aspect-oriented programming;C++ language;control engineering computing;cyber-physical systems;embedded systems;formal specification;real-time systems;robot programming;Unified Modeling Language","ROS-based software;embedded software;distributed cyber-physical systems;real-time systems;C++ code generation;ROS framework;robotic systems;system architecture;industrial systems;complex systems;system specification;industrial cyber-physical systems;robotic operating system framework;aspect-oriented model driven engineering;UML/MARTE models","","4","","29","IEEE","5 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this context, robotic simulators are employed to facilitate the development of these solutions by disseminating knowledge in robotics, Education 4.0, and STEM. The RobotAtFactory 4.0 competition arises to promote improvements in industrial challenges related to autonomous robots. The official organization provides the simulation scene of the competition through the open-source SimTwo simulator. This paper aims to integrate the SiwTwo simulator with the Robot Operating System (ROS) middleware by developing a framework. This integration facilitates the design of robotic systems since ROS has a vast repository of packages that address common problems in robotics. Thus, competitors can use this framework to develop their solutions through ROS, allowing the simulated and real systems to be integrated.","","978-1-6654-8217-2","10.1109/ICARSC55462.2022.9784794","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9784794","Industry 4.0;Education 4.0;Autonomous Mobile Robots;Robotics Simulators;ROS;Fiducial Markers;Indoor Localization System;Pose Estimation","Location awareness;Industries;Service robots;Operating systems;Organizations;Fourth Industrial Revolution;Synchronization","control engineering computing;industrial robots;middleware;mobile robots;operating systems (computers);production engineering computing;production facilities;public domain software;robot programming;STEM","autonomous robots;open-source SimTwo simulator;robot operating system middleware;ROS;robotics competitions;robotic simulators;RobotAtFactory 4.0;industry 4.0;education 4.0;STEM","","2","","26","IEEE","1 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
