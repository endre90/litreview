Coordinating and assigning welding points between robots is a manual and difficult phase that needs to be optimized using automatic tools. The cycle time of the cell strongly depends on different robotic factors such as the task allocation among the robots, the configuration solutions and obstacle avoidance. Moreover, a key aspect, often neglected in the state of the art, is to define a strategy to solve the robotic task sequencing with an effective robot-robot collision avoidance integration. In this paper, we present an efficient iterative algorithm that generates a high-quality solution for Multi-Robotic Task Sequencing Problem. This latter manages not only the mentioned robotic factors but also aspects related to accessibility constraints and mutual collision avoidance. In addition, a home-developed planner (RoboTSPlanner) handling 6 axis has been validated in a real case scenario. In order to ensure the completeness of the proposed methodology, we perform an optimization in the task, configuration and coordination space in a synergistic way. Comparing to the existing approaches, both simulation and real experiments reveal positive results in terms of cycle time and show the ability of this method to be interfaced with both industrial simulation software and ROS-I tools.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2022.3142919","Segula Technologies and Association Nationale Recherche Technologie; Spanish Government(grant numbers:PID2020-114819GB-I00); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9681247","Coordination;intelligent manufacturing;motion planning;optimization;robotic task sequencing","Robot kinematics;Robots;Collision avoidance;Service robots;Task analysis;Sequential analysis;Welding","automobile industry;collision avoidance;control engineering computing;industrial robots;iterative methods;mobile robots;multi-robot systems;optimisation;path planning;welding","multirobotic task sequencing problem;coordination space;industrial simulation software;cycle time optimization;automotive industry;welding sequences;task allocation;configuration solutions;obstacle avoidance;robot-robot collision avoidance integration;RoboTSPlanner;ROS-I tools","","","","20","IEEE","13 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
