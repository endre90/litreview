In this work, an Open Source ROS-based architecture for Fast Software Prototyping for robot arms is proposed, based on Docker containers as a porting tool. This new architecture, called P&P (Plug and Prototype), has been integrated with an Open Source 3D-printed robot arm, to validate its ease of integration and use, also for less expert users. The P&P design is introduced and proposed as a standard for robot arms applications development, thanks to its modular and easily extensible structure.","1946-0759","978-1-5386-7108-5","10.1109/ETFA.2018.8502518","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8502518","","Software;Computer architecture;Tools;Libraries;Manipulators;Hardware","control engineering computing;public domain software;robot programming;software architecture;software prototyping","fast software prototyping;Open Source resources;Open Source ROS-based architecture;Open Source 3D-printed robot arm;standard architecture;P&P design;Plug and Prototype;Docker containers","","1","","42","IEEE","25 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The setup's single components are not accessible nor exchangeable, often due to them being specially tuned and adjusted to fulfill the demanding requirements for robotic control. The open-source framework ROS enables to combine these monolithic controllers with simple interfaces, therefore allowing more complex robotic applications. The next generation, ROS2, targets highly modular systems of sensors, actuators and controllers, each being interchangeable and further providing real-time capabilities by employing DDS as middleware. This study uses system inherent tools alongside non-invasive measurements for comprehensive insights, thereby guiding to ROS2 applications on an underlying distributed and synchronized real-time Linux system.","2161-8089","978-1-7281-6904-0","10.1109/CASE48305.2020.9217010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9217010","","Real-time systems;Linux;Synchronization;Hardware;Kernel;Service robots","actuators;control engineering computing;industrial robots;Linux;middleware;public domain software;real-time systems;sensors","real-time robotic control;monolithic black-box controller;individual robotic manufacturers;modern industrial robots;open-source framework ROS;monolithic controllers;simple interfaces;complex robotic applications;actuators;ROS2 applications;distributed system;middleware;non-invasive measurements;synchronized real-time Linux system;sensors","","9","","21","IEEE","8 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some of this intelligence exist on a per-component basis in the form of vision, sensing, motion, and path planning algorithms. To fully take advantage of this intelligence, also the coordination of subsystems need to exhibit intelligence. While there exist middleware solutions that eases communication, development, and reuse of such subsystems, for example the Robot Operating System (ROS), good coordination also requires knowledge about how control is supposed to be performed, as well as expected behavior of the subsystems. This paper introduces lightweight components that wraps ROS2 nodes into composable control components from which an intelligent control system can be built. The ideas are implemented on a use case involving collaborative robots with on-line path planning, intelligent tools, and human operators.","1946-0759","978-1-7281-0303-7","10.1109/ETFA.2019.8869112","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8869112","Control Architectures and Programming;Factory Automation;Planning;Scheduling and Coordination","Planning;Automation;Collaboration;Task analysis;Robots;Control systems;Tools","industrial robots;intelligent control;mobile robots;path planning","intelligent automation systems;intelligent control system;per-component basis;path planning algorithms;lightweight components;composable control components;collaborative robots;intelligent tools;collaborative automation systems;robot operating system;ROS2 nodes;on-line path planning;human operators","","7","","18","IEEE","17 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed framework is a modular and cost-effective open-source hardware and software platform that is intended to help develop multiagent systems for research and education. Numerous multi-agent platforms have been developed in the literature to date that are used in various robotic applications, such as surveillance, target localization, cooperative estimation, among others. However, most of them are either tailored towards particular applications or driven by expensive software and hardware. The proposed MAFOSS system is developed for robotic applications, where a team of mobile agents (robots) is deployed to achieve a common goal. A major contribution of the MAFOSS system is the development of an open-hardware platform for differential-drive mobile robots (herein called “eduMOD” mobile robots). The software architecture of the current framework mostly relies on the robot operating system (ROS). Regardless of internal hardware and/or software architecture, appropriate actions can be applied to actuators of an individual or a team of mobile agents for controlling their motions. A few case studies have been conducted to evaluate the performance of MAFOSS.","","978-1-7281-2971-6","10.1109/ICOM47790.2019.8952052","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8952052","MAFOSS;multi-agent systems;mobile robots;motion control;sensors","","mobile agents;mobile robots;multi-agent systems;public domain software;robot programming","robot operating system;eduMOD mobile robots;differential-drive mobile robots;open-source hardware platform;MAFOSS system;robotic applications;multiagent systems;open-source software platform;mobile agents","","1","","16","IEEE","9 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is particularly pertinent in the field of manufacturing, where human-robot collaboration is on the increase, but where standards and proprietary software are key barriers to deployment and adoption.In this article we present the ROSIE Adapter, a general-purpose, modular adapter developed in ROS designed to support the creation and connection of industry-ready digital twins. Together with our previous work on the modular CSI digital-twin framework, we demonstrate how the ROSIE Adapter creates a versatile ""plug-and-play"" interface that simplifies the development of new robotic processes, and improves accessibility to novice users. Furthermore, the adaptor supports integration of intuitive interface devices, such as speech and augmented reality interfaces, which enable more natural collaboration. We describe the adaptor and its use in two real-world applications, demonstrate the ease of use via a three-day hackathon event, and provide results showing the faithfulness of the arising digital twins to their connected physical systems.","1944-9437","978-1-7281-8859-1","10.1109/RO-MAN53752.2022.9900842","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9900842","","Adaptation models;Collaboration;Process control;Data models;Digital twins;Safety;Speech processing","augmented reality;human-robot interaction;mobile robots;user interfaces","ROS Adapter;modular digital twinning framework;robotic systems;human-robot collaboration;proprietary software;key barriers;ROSIE Adapter;general-purpose;modular adapter;industry-ready digital twins;modular CSI digital-twin framework;plug- play interface;-play interface;robotic processes;adaptor;intuitive interface devices;augmented reality interfaces;natural collaboration;arising digital twins;connected physical systems","","","","27","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
