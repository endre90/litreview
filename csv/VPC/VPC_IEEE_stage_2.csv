The different approaches and key factors to reduce the costs are to investigate how to reduce the development time of modeling and which practice or standard is most suitable for a certain application. A developer needs to expand the utilization of the virtual work and the re-usability of its digital models, in addition, to find a balance of the required level of modeling details according to the required functionality. This paper presents a framework with a modular software setup that simulates a 3-DOF robot in three different cases with different levels of detail. The outcome of the cases is evaluated in the context of functionality, usefulness, and affordability. The paper further discusses and explores potential use in regards to the concept of Virtual Commissioning and Digital Twin.","","978-1-7281-2989-1","10.1109/ETFA45728.2021.9613654","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9613654","modeling;modular systems;co-simulation;digital twin;digital model;virtual preparation;virtual commissioning","Software packages;Digital twin;Focusing;Computer architecture;Software quality;Tools;Tuning","automobile industry;control engineering computing;cost reduction;industrial robots;investment;software quality;virtual manufacturing","digital twin architecture;virtual engineering;automotive industry;software quality;physical commissioning time;digital models;virtual commissioning;modular virtual preparation method;investment;cost reduction;3-DOF robot","","1","","23","IEEE","30 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A good test environment can also be extended to a learning environment with appropriate trial and error based algorithms. This work shows an approach to extend an industrial software tool for virtual commissioning as a standardized OpenAI gym environment. Thereby, established reinforcement learning algorithms can be used more easily and a step towards an industrial application of self-learning control systems can be made.

VCOM is carried out in advance of the commissioning of the real plant, using a simulated plant. However, the hard transition from the simulated to the real plant proves to be problematic if components of the real plant are not available. In these cases the hybrid commissioning (HCOM) method, a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation setup including both real and simulated components, is desirable. In this article, the disadvantages of a hard transition of VCOM, the concept of the HCOM and it's benefits for commissioning production plants are explained and discussed.

The use of virtual commissioning tools is a good contribution to achieve this goal. Ideally, those tools should be part of a virtual engineering environment sharing same virtual model, the digital twin, through the complete lifecycle of the automated system, namely the project, simulation, implementation and execution/monitoring/supervision and, eventually decommissioning phases. Such vision includes a digital twin with a broader use, which is consistent with the real system and one that can be used after the early design and commissioning phases. Finding a complete set of tools able to comply with the above requirements can be extremely challenging. In this paper we explore the use of the ABB RobotStudio software combined with the OPC UA standard with this vision in mind. Methodologies were defined to integrate both new generation and legacy equipment, as well as robot controllers and guidelines for equipment development. A key result of this work is the development of a set of virtual engineering tools and methodologies based on OPC UA and implemented using RobotStudio in order to accomplish the complete lifecycle support of an automated system, from the project and simulation phases, to the monitoring and supervision phases, suitable for integration in Industry 4.0 factories.

Among the others, virtual testing is expected to play a major role in the future. Differently from other methods, virtual testing allows examining an ADS in complex driving scenarios involving several road users and characterized by any level of criticality in a safe, efficient and effective way. However, before virtual testing can be used in the ADS certification process, proper validation methodologies have to be established to ensure the appropriateness of the simulation-generated evidence to the end of establishing a “virtual proving ground” regardless of the specific ADS. In this context, the present paper summarizes the results of the virtual environment validation exercise which involved a Vehicle-Hardware-in-the-Loop (VeHIL) setup against real-world experiments. The analysis only embraces the longitudinal dynamics due to the limitation of the virtual environment. Nonetheless, the methodology presented can be straightforwardly extended to different toolchains to cover more advanced ADS for the sake of virtual certification. The manuscript has a twofold contribution. On one side, it gives a quantitative estimation of the fidelity level achievable using a state-of-the-art VeHIL environment, thus standing apart from validation activities purely based on qualitative comparisons and contributions mostly concerned with the validation of the ADS itself. Secondly, it provides an end-to-end validation procedure that could be generalized to other cases of study or different testing setups. The results achieved are encouraging as they show an overall good match between real-world and simulated data. However, open issues remain in order to define a complete validation framework for virtual testing environments.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3171180","European Commission Joint Research Centre; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9765490","Automated driving;model validation;simulation;virtual testing","Testing;Vehicle dynamics;Certification;Pipelines;Standards;Europe;Virtual environments","certification;driver information systems;road safety;road traffic;road vehicles;testing","virtual testing environments;longitudinal dynamics validation example;safety validation;complex driving scenarios;ADS certification process;proper validation methodologies;virtual proving ground;virtual environment validation exercise;virtual certification;validation activities;end-to-end validation procedure;testing setups;automated driving systems certification","","2","","32","CCBY","29 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One step toward the automation of the design and simulation of new charging stations can be reached through the integration of the EV-specific standards and protocols with other widely spread electrical standards and, thereby, improving the compatibility between standards, increasing the reuse of the intelligent work results, and promoting the development of EVs’ infrastructure. A method for virtual commissioning of electrical charging stations is proposed, implemented, and tested in a form of a software tool in which the electrical system description from the widely used IEC 61850 standard is used as an input. The designed tool builds a digital twin of the charging station that consists of its Simulink model as well as two automatically generated communication code primitives using the open charge point protocol for control and management purposes over the autogenerated model. The generated digital twin can be used for virtual commissioning purposes.

There are various simulation tools with different advantages available. Selecting one tool has consequences for the whole engineering process. The exchange of models across different tools is not possible or discouraged by the respective vendors due to various reasons. This paper describes a concept to exchange behavior models via the table-based import interfaces for an automated model generation within common simulation tools. The concept utilizes an approach to exchange the behavior of components using the vendor-neutral and standardized programming language PLCopenXML containing all IEC 61131-3 programming languages.

In applications in which several automation systems are used, such as in aeronautics or automotive manufacturing cells, several PLC's and drives are used to control the motion of the different electromechanical components. In order to verify and validate (V&V) automation code before deployment in the production environment, virtual commissioning (VC) techniques have become of great interest in the last decades. Even if VC simulation approaches, based on software/hardware-in-the-loop (SiL, HiL), have shown effectiveness to V&V automation code, the continuity from the execution to the simulation layers may not be ensured due to a lack of interoperability in the toolchain. Additionally, the development of reliable component models is a complex task of the VC solution since it requires a high level of mechatronics expertise. In order to avoid losing information between the execution and the simulation layers of VC toolchains, this paper presents a SiL based approach for interconnecting the PLC's with the VC simulation tool by means of OPC-UA-based technologies. In addition, in order to develop the functional models, we propose a library-based development. This will facilitate seamless flow of information between different PLC editors and the simulation layer. SiL simulations of the suggested approach on an automotive manufacturing cell are performed and show digital continuity from the execution to the simulation layer.","","978-1-7281-2989-1","10.1109/ETFA45728.2021.9613490","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9613490","virtual commissioning;interoperability;OPC UA;PLC","Codes;Simulation;Semantics;Tools;Manufacturing;Servers;Reliability","automobile manufacture;control engineering computing;delays;hardware-in-the-loop simulation;lead time reduction;mechatronics;motion control;open systems;production engineering computing;programmable controllers;virtual manufacturing","lead-time reduction;on-site commissioning;automotive manufacturing cell;electromechanical components;SiL based approach;VC simulation tool;OPC-UA-based technologies;library-based development;interoperability;industrial manufacturing processes;virtual commissioning toolchains;verify and validate automation code;software-in-the-loop;hardware-in-the-loop;PLC;motion control;mechatronics;HiL","","","","14","EU","30 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Smart factory, Compared to traditional factories, smart factory needs to possess high flexibility and stability and often has to employ digital twin. Compared to IEC 61131-3 standard used in traditional industrial production, IEC 61499 standard can bring more advantages to meet the realization of Smart Factory, such as flexibility, distribution and event-driven execution. In this paper, we propose a new Virtual Commissioning (VC) architecture for IEC 61499-based control applications. We build an online collaborative VC platform with the help of cloud computing and containerization technologies. Furthermore, we discuss and propose the utilization of soft-PLC containers from different vendors to meet users’ commissioning requirements for different hardware configurations. Compared with the traditional offline single-person debugging method, our proposed architecture can improve the flexibility, collaboration and efficiency of control software debugging in a more interactive and collaborative style via the online platform we implemented.","2577-1647","978-1-6654-3554-3","10.1109/IECON48115.2021.9589945","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9589945","IEC 61499;containerization;web;cloud computing;distributed control application","Manufacturing industries;Industrial electronics;Cloud computing;Collaboration;Computer architecture;Production facilities;IEC Standards","cloud computing;control engineering computing;factory automation;IEC standards;industrial economics;manufacturing industries;production engineering computing;production facilities;programmable controllers;software architecture","cloud-based virtual commissioning;distributed automation applications;smart factory;traditional factories;IEC 61131-3 standard;traditional industrial production;IEC 61499 standard;IEC 61499-based control applications;cloud computing;containerization technologies;virtual commissioning architecture;manufacturing industries;customers demand;volatile market;digitalization;digital twin;event-driven execution;online collaborative VC platform;soft-PLC containers;hardware configurations;control software debugging","","4","","19","IEEE","10 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

High costs for commissioning and the use of systems specialized for specific tasks are some of the biggest challenges. Hence modular systems and methods for the virtual commissioning of such are required. We present a new solution for the virtual commissioning of modular systems including detailed physical behavior models. This approach combines the object-oriented multi-domain modeling language Modelica with real-time robot simulation, real-time visualization, contact dynamics and OPC UA technology. It enables the simulation of the system on multiple levels of detail, from the kinematics of the mobile platform to the programming of the robot with G-code up to the forces of the drill process in detail. Our use case is a mobile robot system performing drilling operations on a vertical tail plane shell of an airplane. The system consists of the modules platform, navigation, robot, precision, and drill. A central, high-level controller is used to orchestrate the processes of the modules both for the real and the virtual hardware. The exchangeability between real modules and their virtual counterparts becomes possible due to uniform OPC-UA-based interfaces.","","978-3-8007-5891-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9861797","","","","","","","","","","19 Aug 2022","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

Such systems require complex control algorithms managing the given flexibility and coordinating the cyber-physical entities. Control algorithms can be organized either in a centralized or decentralized manner. For the development and the performance evaluation of both types of algorithms, no standardized framework exists using the same boundary conditions. Following the principles of virtual commissioning, this work presents a framework composed of three elements: a simulation model representing a modular assembly system, a multi-agent system incorporating centralized or decentralized control logic, and an interface for data-exchange. The framework has been successfully validated implementing a centralized approach, where the system followed a global schedule and a decentralized approach, where a bidding-based agent-system controlled the production flow.","2577-1655","978-1-7281-4569-3","10.1109/SMC.2019.8914314","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8914314","virtual commissioning;cyber-physical production system;digital manufacturing;scheduling;production control;multi-agent system;modular assembly system.","Workstations;Assembly systems;Control systems;Schedules;Job shop scheduling","assembling;automatic guided vehicles;decentralised control;multi-agent systems","modular assembly system;multiagent system;decentralized control logic;bidding-based agent-system;decentralized control systems;flexible modular assembly systems;cyber-physical production systems;automated guided vehicles;complex control algorithms;performance evaluation","","7","","31","IEEE","28 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
