Data and digital twins offer an opportunity to enable this revolution and secure sustainable future smart infrastructure. In this article, we discuss data as an engineering tool and propose to use data throughout the asset's whole life cycle from identifying the need, planning and designing to construction, operation, integration and maintenance. This requires systems thinking where focus is not limited to the problems but rather constructs a systemic perspective to understand the interrelationships between components and systems. Future infrastructure is connected, intelligent and data-driven. To enable more sustainable decision-making, we should not only consider how to integrate different infrastructure elements but also use data to monitor, learn from and inform decisions. To this end, we present a case study where several assets, such as bridges, railways and transport systems are integrated, and data are curated for the purpose of aiding climate-conscious, sustainable decision-making. An example systems architecture for integration of different digital twins is explained and benefits of this data-driven, systemic perspective are discussed.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3055652","Centre for Digital Built Britain through the Government’s Modern Industrial Strategy by Innovate U.K.; U.K. Research and Innovation; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)/Innovate U.K. Centre for Smart Infrastructure and Construction(grant numbers:EP/N021614/1,920035); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9340179","Data science;cyber-physical system;information systems;sustainability;systems thinking","Sustainable development;Digital twin;Decision making;Tools;Systems architecture;Stakeholders;Economics","cyber-physical systems;data handling;decision making;learning (artificial intelligence)","engineering tool;sustainable cyber-physical systems;secure sustainable future smart infrastructure;sustainable decision-making;digital twins;learning","","10","","58","CCBY","29 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The development of smart devices, the continuous evolution of software tools and the implementation of new communication protocols make it possible to implement sophisticated techniques for control, supervision and optimization of industrial processes. Digital Twins are an approach for integrating physical systems to virtual counterparts that replicate in the virtual space the operation of real instruments and machines. Its main objective is to improve the real system performance by using information generated by the virtual counterpart, for example, by executing performance analysis, bottleneck identification, failure prediction, detection of deviations and others. Some of the biggest challenges on this context are creating trustworthy models with acceptable computational costs, assuring real-time communication and developing deep analysis methods. This paper presents the development of a modular architecture for implementing Digital Twins. The architecture is based on an open-source tool for process control, lightweight protocols and flexible tools for modeling and 3D visualization.

Ever since then, driven by remarkable industrial attention, digital twins flourished and ripened in several sectors. The notable industrial adoption has been sided by a growing interest from the software engineering community in general and the software architecture community in particular as demonstrated by the growing number of published peer-reviewed publications and proposed software architectural solutions for digital twins. In this paper, we report on the planning, execution, and results of a systematic mapping study on architecting digital twins. The study captures crucial aspects of software architectures for digital twins as types of architectural solutions, quality attributes, and architectural patterns. It supports practitioners in creating digital twins tailored to their specific needs and researchers in identifying trends and open challenges. Starting from an initial set of potentially relevant 1630 peer-reviewed publications, we selected 140 primary studies. We analysed the set of primary studies using thorough data extraction, analysis, and synthesis process. To compensate for single method limitations and reduce possible threats to conclusion validity, we discussed the results of our study with experts in the software architecture community. Based on our results, the field of software architecture for digital twins is lively and an increasing number of architectural solutions are being proposed.

Digital Twin (DT) has become the key technology and tool for manufacturing industries to realize intelligent cyber-physical integration and digital transformation by leveraging these technologies. Although there have been many DT-related works, there is no standard definition, unified framework, and implementation approach of DT until now. Widely developing DTs for the manufacturing industry is still challenging. Thus, this paper proposes a novel implementation framework of digital twins for intelligent manufacturing, denoted as IF-DTiM, which possesses several distinct merits to distinguish itself from previous works. First, IF-DTiM fully utilizes new-generation container technology so that DT-related applications and services can be packaged in a self-contained way, rapidly deployed, and robustly operated with the capabilities of failover, autoscaling, and load balancing. Second, it leverages existing intelligent cloud manufacturing services to realize the intelligence for DT externally in a scalable and plug-and-play manner instead of using traditional approaches to embed intelligence in DT. Third, IF-DTiM contains Product DT for products, Equipment DT (i.e., EQ DT) for equipment, and Process DT for production lines, which can generically fulfill the demands and scenarios to achieve intelligent manufacturing for various manufacturing industries. Testing results show that IF-DTiM can achieve remarkable performance in rapid deployment and real-time data exchanges of DT-related applications. Finally, we develop an example DTiM system for CNC machining based on IF-DTiM to demonstrate its efficacy and applicability in facilitating the manufacturing industry to build their DT systems. Note to Practitioners—Developing Digital Twin (DT) systems to realize intelligent manufacturing is challenging. The proposed IF-DTiM (Implementation Framework of Digital Twins for Intelligent Manufacturing) provides a novel container-technology and cloud-manufacturing-service-based systematic methodology for building DTiM. In this paper, we present the system architecture and several operational scenarios (e.g., how to create and use DTs) of IF-DTiM, together with the design of its core functional mechanisms (e.g., rapid deployment scheme for DT, real-time data exchange for DT, DT interface pattern, and general workflow architecture for DT). Also, an example DTiM system for CNC machining based on IF-DTiM is presented to facilitate the practitioners to adopt the designs and niches in IF-DTiM to build their desired DTiM systems.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2022.3143832","Intelligent Manufacturing Research Center (iMRC) through the Featured Areas Research Center Program within the framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in Taiwan; Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 110-2218-E-006-027,MOST 108-2221-E-034-015-MY2,MOST 110-2221-E-034-009-MY2,MOST 110-2221-E-006-124); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9697094","Implementation framework;digital twins;intelligent manufacturing;container technology","Manufacturing;Containers;Digital twin;Software;Manufacturing industries;Fourth Industrial Revolution;Cloud computing","cloud computing;computerised numerical control;containers;cyber-physical systems;intelligent manufacturing systems;machining;manufacturing industries;production engineering computing;real-time systems","cloud-manufacturing-service-based systematic methodology;DT interface pattern;novel implementation framework;intelligent manufacturing;intelligent cyber-physical integration;digital twins;new-generation container technology;IF-DTiM system;core technologies;industry 4.0;manufacturing industries;digital transformation;real-time data exchanges;CNC machining","","5","","46","IEEE","31 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Both the link and the virtual representation can be realized in several different ways. However, the ambiguous meanings associated with the term digital twin are causing unnecessary miscommunications as people have different interpretations of what can be accomplished with it. To provide clarity around the concept, we introduce a general approach to analyze and construct digital twins in various applications. We identify the common features of digital twins from earlier literature and propose an analysis method that compares digital twin instances based on these features. The method is used to verify the existence of the features and can be further enhanced. We formulate the observations to a feature-based digital twin framework (FDTF) to universally define and structure digital twins. The framework consists of three main principles: i) the idea that all digital twins consist of a definite set of features, ii) the features can be used to compare digital twin instances to each other, and iii) the features can be combined via a data link feature to construct future digital twins more efficiently. As key contributions, we found that the features can be identified in existing digital twin implementations and the feature combinations of the implementations are diverse. We suggest that the features should be leveraged to provide clarity and efficiency in digital twin discussion and implementation. We further propose a general procedure for building digital twins.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2950507","Business Finland(grant numbers:8205/31/2017 “DigiTwin,”); Academy of Finland(grant numbers:313675 “TwinRotor”); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8887161","Digital twin;enterprise systems;Industrial Internet of Things;cyber-physical systems","Diffusion tensor imaging;Terminology;Atmospheric modeling;Internet of Things;Tools","cyber-physical systems;Internet of Things;production engineering computing","feature-based framework;industrial digital twins;feature-based digital twin framework;data link feature;Industrial Internet of Things;cyber-physical systems","","64","","87","CCBY","30 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
