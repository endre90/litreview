However, in reality, these expectations are still not met and, in practice, the industry very rarely uses the MAS design methodologies, technologies, and software tools despite the appearance of many new classes of applications for which the MAS paradigm could be the perfect match. This paper analyzes the barriers and trends of the mismatch between the recent industrial anticipations and the real state of the practical use of MAS. It identifies engineering problems with very little re-use of code that currently stops economics of scale and impedes the extensive industrial MAS deployment and the ways to overcome them.","2577-1655","978-1-7281-8526-2","10.1109/SMC42975.2020.9283071","Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9283071","Multi-agent systems;smart system;industrial applications;decision making;agent interaction;self-organization;eco-system of smart services;systems of systems","Industries;Biological system modeling;Software algorithms;Tools;Market research;Data models;Software tools","multi-agent systems;software tools","industrial applications;multiagent systems;high expectations;industrial IT community;MAS design methodologies;software tools;MAS paradigm;perfect match;multiagent technology;industrial MAS deployment;industrial anticipations","","2","","59","IEEE","14 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The most common approach to develop such control systems is with agents embedded in a platform that provides software libraries and runtime services that ease the development process. These platforms also bring challenges to the agent-based control system engineering. For example, they might introduce default design features, such as a global directory of agents. Furthermore, agents are generally locked in a platform and depend on the platform’s available support for deployment across computing infrastructures. This article addresses these challenges through an approach for building agent-based control systems, that relaxes the dependencies in multiagent system (MAS) platforms, through the use of container-based virtualisation. The proposed approach is elaborated via a reference architecture that enables the implementation of agents as self-contained applications that can be deployed, on-demand, in independent environments but still are able to communicate and coordinate with other agents of the control system. We built a prototype using this approach and evaluated it in the context of a case study for the supervisory control of digital network infrastructures. This case study enabled us to demonstrate feasibility of the approach and to show the flexibility, of the resulting control system, to adopt several topologies as well as to operate at different scales, over emulated networks. We also concluded that designing agents as individual deployment units is also cost-effective especially in control scenarios with low number of stable agents.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3059273","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) through the BT Prosperity Partnership Project: Next Generation Converged Digital Infrastructure(grant numbers:EP/R004935/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9354153","Agent-based control;multiagent systems;micro services;container-based virtualisation industrial control;system containers","Control systems;Computer architecture;Scalability;Industrial control;Multi-agent systems;Cloud computing;Tools","control engineering computing;industrial control;multi-agent systems;software libraries","agent-based control systems;industrial control systems;agent-based control system engineering;multiagent system;container-based virtualisation;supervisory control;control scenarios;stable agents","","3","","63","CCBY","12 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents a generic CPPS (cyber-physical production system) architecture that copes with SMEs specific challenges and simplifies the implementation of the Industry 4.0 paradigm in real world applications. The proposed CPPS architecture has been validated in an industrial pilot application. The COSMIXER-CPPS is able to control devices with different interfaces and protocols as well as to communicate with external databases and web-services. The unified communication middleware within the CPPS enables furthermore the reconfiguration and scaling of the system with minimal disruption. This research is a contribution to reduce inhibitions towards the implementation of Industry 4.0 in SMEs, further research has to be carried out to investigate and enhance the dependability, security, real-time capability and performance of SME-friendly CPPS.","","978-1-7281-6207-2","10.1109/ICPS49255.2021.9468232","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9468232","cyber-physical production systems;CPPS;Industry 4.0;multi-agent systems;MAS;small and medium enterprises;SMEs","Production systems;Protocols;Databases;Ecosystems;Real-time systems;Complexity theory;Security","cyber-physical systems;middleware;multi-agent systems;service-oriented architecture;small-to-medium enterprises;software agents;Web services","cyber-physical production system;small and medium enterprises;high technological complexity;high investment;operation cost;complex systems;generic CPPS;CPPS architecture;industrial pilot application;COSMIXER-CPPS;SME-friendly CPPS;generic multi agent based architecture","","2","","19","IEEE","5 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Expectations from such systems continuously rise and become more ambitious: long lifetime, high reliability, high performance, energy efficiency, and adaptability, particularly in the presence of changing environments. Computational self-awareness promises a comprehensive assessment of the system state for sensible and well-informed actions and resource management. Computational self-awareness concepts can be used in many applications such as automated manufacturing plants, telecommunication systems, autonomous driving, traffic control, smart grids, and wearable health monitoring systems. Developing self-aware systems from scratch for each application is the most common practice currently, but this is highly redundant, inefficient, and uneconomic. Hence, we propose a framework that supports modeling and evaluation of various self-aware concepts in hierarchical agent systems, where agents are made up of self-aware functionalities. This paper presents the Research on Self-Awareness (RoSA) framework and its design principles. In addition, self-aware functionalities abstraction, data reliability, and confidence, which are currently provided by RoSA, are described. Potential use cases of RoSA are discussed. Capabilities of the proposed framework are showcased by case studies from the fields of healthcare and industrial monitoring. We believe that RoSA is capable of serving as a common framework for self-aware modeling and applications and thus helps researchers and engineers in exploring the vast design space of hierarchical agent-based systems with computational self-awareness.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3012824","Federal Ministry Republic of Austria for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (BMVIT)/Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) under the program Production of the Future in the project SAVE(grant numbers:FFG 864883); European Union’s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation(grant numbers:674875 (oCPS Marie Curie Network)); Tekniikan Edistämissäätiö (Finnish Foundation for Technology Promotion); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9151960","Computational self-awareness;framework;agent-based;hierarchical;modeling;development;monitoring;observe-decide-act","Monitoring;Computer architecture;Reliability;Computational modeling;Sensors;Aerospace electronics;Adaptation models","cyber-physical systems;health care;multi-agent systems;patient monitoring;process monitoring;production engineering computing","RoSA;cyber-physical systems;smart systems;autonomous systems;energy efficiency;system state;resource management;computational self-awareness concepts;automated manufacturing plants;telecommunication systems;autonomous driving;wearable health monitoring systems;hierarchical agent systems;data reliability;industrial monitoring;hierarchical agent-based systems;self-aware functionality abstraction","","8","","104","CCBY","29 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
